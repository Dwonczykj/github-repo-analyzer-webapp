\
## Purpose\
Our test is designed to be open-ended and non-prescriptive, and this is by design. We understand and appreciate that developers possess diverse sets of skills and talents, each with their own unique toolbox. Our goal is to gain insight into your individual abilities and what you consider significant in your work. We look forward to discovering your talents and skills throughout this assessment.\
\
## Assessment Overview\
\
Create an application using any Javascript Framework of your choice, which will allow a user to connect to GitHub via an API client. The application should provide the user with the ability to navigate between various features as described below.\
\
We will assess your deliverable based on your code neatness, readability, logical flow, visual design and speed.\
All individuals have different strengths so be sure to choose the approach to problem solving that suits your strengths.\
\
## Use cases:\
\
1. As a User I would like to search github in order to view the available repositories for a given search term\
\
2. As a User I would like to select a particular repository in order to view more details of the selected repository\
\
3. As a user, when viewing a given repository, I should be able to clearly see the URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc\
\
4. As a User I would like to link off to the actual GitHub page where the repository is located in order to view the code in the repository\
\
5. As a User I would like to view a list of all the current issues for a repository in order to view the backlog of issues\
\
6. As a User I would like to filter the list of issues between STATE = ["Open" or "Closed"] in order to look through the filtered list\
\
7. Optional: As a User I would like to view a chart that displays the breakdown of issues for the repository (open vs closed) in order to visually see how well built and maintained the repository is\
\
\
## Additional Points and Notes:\
\
1. Implement the best design possible for the user interface. You are encouraged to make use of interface design solutions such as Twitter Bootstrap, Material and any other libraries you may deem necessary to provide your best solution.\
2. Focus on using best practices in writing TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. Write clearly and use proper MVC structure to write the application. Show us what your typical standard of work, as well as the kind of standards you want to work to.\
